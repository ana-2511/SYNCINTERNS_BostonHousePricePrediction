 Boston House üè† Price Prediction.
Here I have used a dataset with 500+ information about the surroundings and rent of houses located in Boston. It is a regression model and the algorithms which I have used are :
Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, SVM Regressor.
Considering the metrics, Random Forest appears to perform the best among the evaluated algorithms, as it consistently shows the lowest values for R-squared, MSE, MAE, and RMSE. It's important to note that the choice of the "best" algorithm may depend on the specific goals and requirements of your regression task.
